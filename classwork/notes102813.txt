 a character takes up one byte
 each character you define in the array takes up a byte
 char y[]={'A','3','c','c',3};
 there are five elements in the array so it is five bytes
 y[0]=5 ASCII
or'A'
 y[1]=51 ASCII
or '3'
 y[5] is undefined and only goes from 0-4
char z[20]="Hello World";
the array has 20 bytes
11 characters are stored but a NULL character is always placed at the end with double quotes
z[3] is l
z[5] is the space
char name[]="Sam Jones"
    if set is left empty it will be made the exact right size
char state[2]="NC";
this is not ok they didn't leave room for the null character
needs to have 3 elements

char x[10];
scanf("%s", x);
no &
x is the name of the array
x is the addressto the 1st element of the array

why %s is better than %c
1)maintains the null character
2)skips white space characters
3)max# of characters the user can enter is one minus size of the array
4)cannot have whitespace characters
5)if the user enters in more than 9 characters it will eventually end up a core dump

char fname[20], lname[20]
scanf("%s %s",fname, lname);

check in the notes
