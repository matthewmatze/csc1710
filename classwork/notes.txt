Chapter 7 Arrays

basics of arrays

treat 2-d arrays as pixels from 0,0 to w-1 and h-1
1)when you process pixels not from the right hand corner you use an array
2)if you blend two images it is easier in an array
3)want to mirror or resize an image

int x[10] is an array of size ten
x[0]-x[9]
int is 4 bytes
x[1000] uses four megabytes

by default array is not initialized

you can initialize an array by using:

1)assignment statements
ex.
   int a[5];
a[0]=3;
a[2]=5;
a[4]=a[0]+a[2];

a[5] isn't anything
2)a[0]=a[1]=a[2]=0;

3)use a for loop

4)int x[]={1,1,2,3,5,8};
the array is the number of initializers
they are arranged in the order they are entered
5)user can fill in the array

process until and user EOF
in unix user puts in control d to tell end of file
in dos control z does it

we need to know how many is the max size of the array

how to scan in 100 numbers in an array look at notes from shore

print out values in array x

question
suppose array x has been loaded with cnt values
x[0]x[1]x[2]x[3]...x[cnt-1]

look at fibonacci program
